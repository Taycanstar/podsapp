# Exercise Selection Framework for Adaptive Strength Training App

## Overview

This guide synthesizes peer-reviewed research, coaching frameworks (ACSM, NSCA, Haff, Schoenfeld), and elite programming practices to provide a systematic, codifiable exercise selection framework for adaptive strength training apps. It covers selection criteria by goal, experience level, injury history, equipment availability, and periodization phase.

## Exercise Selection Taxonomy

### Exercise Type Classifications

**1. Core (Compound) Exercises**
- Definition: Multi-joint exercises involving ≥2 major joints and multiple muscle groups.
- Examples: Squat, deadlift, bench press, rows, pull-ups, Olympic lifts (snatch, clean & jerk).
- Rationale: Maximum mechanical tension; highest neural recruitment; sport specificity; time-efficient.
- Priority: Always prioritized in program design (perform first when CNS fresh).
- Evidence: Multi-joint exercises produce greater 1RM strength gains than single-joint for the trained lift (exercise specificity).[2][3]

**2. Structural Exercises**
- Definition: Compound movements that load the spine directly (barbell) or indirectly (dumbbell lunges).
- Examples: Back squat, front squat, deadlift, overhead press, barbell rows, dumbbell presses.
- Rationale: High systemic fatigue; CNS demand; greatest strength/hypertrophy stimulus.
- Periodization context: Prioritized in intensity-focused blocks (strength, power); reduced volume in endurance-metabolic blocks.

**3. Power Exercises**
- Definition: Structural exercises performed explosively (high rate of force development).
- Examples: Olympic lifts (snatch, clean & jerk), plyometrics (jump squats, box jumps), kettlebell swings, medicine ball throws.
- Rep scheme: 1–3 reps per set, ≥80% 1RM or maximal velocity.
- Rationale: Rate of force development (RFD); sport-specific power; neural adaptation.
- Contraindication: Avoid when fatigued or with poor technique (high injury risk).

**4. Assistance (Secondary/Accessory) Exercises**
- Definition: Single-joint or limited multi-joint exercises targeting specific muscle groups or weaknesses.
- Examples: Leg press, leg extension, leg curl, leg-press, chest-supported row, cable fly, tricep pushdown, bicep curl.
- Rationale: Muscle balance; weak-point correction; injury prevention; metabolic stress.
- Priority: Secondary; performed after core/structural exercises; higher rep ranges (6–15 reps).
- Evidence: Single-joint exercises improve strength in that specific lift (exercise specificity) but do NOT transfer equally to other multijoint movements.[2]

**5. Recovery/Mobility Exercises**
- Definition: Low-stress movements promoting parasympathetic reactivation and ROM.
- Examples: Foam rolling, stretching, sled push/pull (low load), swimming, yoga, light walking, band pull-aparts.
- Rationale: Active recovery days; deload weeks; mobility/movement quality restoration.
- Frequency: Daily or as separate "recovery" sessions.

↓
Step 5: EXERCISE SELECTION CRITERIA
  ├─ Core exercise? → Prioritize (perform first)
  ├─ Movement pattern match? → Rank by specificity
  └─ Equipment available? → Select best available option

↓
STEP 6: VALIDATE & EXECUTE
  ├─ Is form safe? 
  ├─ Is load/rep scheme appropriate for phase?
  └─ Is recovery capacity sufficient?

↓
END: Exercise selected; add to program

## Exercise Selection By Goal

### STRENGTH (1RM Maximization)

**Core Exercise Priority:**
| Exercise Pattern | Primary Lift | Rep Range | Load (%1RM) | Sets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lower Quad-Dominant** | Back Squat (barbell) | 2–5 | 85–90% | 4–6 | Competition lift; highest transfer |
| **Lower Hip-Dominant** | Deadlift (barbell) | 1–5 | 85–95% | 3–5 | Competition lift; maximal tension |
| **Upper Push** | Bench Press (barbell) | 2–5 | 85–90% | 4–6 | Competition lift; horizontal pressing |
| **Upper Pull** | Barbell Row (pendlay/comp.) | 3–5 | 80–90% | 4–6 | Horizontal pulling; back strength |

**Accessory Exercises (if needed):**
| Target Weakness | Exercise | Modality | Rep Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quad weakness (depth)** | Front Squat, Paused Back Squat | Barbell | 3–5 | Addresses sticking point |
| **Hip extension lag** | Pin Deadlift (4–8"), Deadlift Deficit | Barbell | 2–5 | Strengthens weak ROM |
| **Lockout strength (bench)** | Pin Press (2–4"), Board Press | Barbell | 2–5 | Addresses sticking point |
| **Upper back lag** | Pendlay Row, Seal Row | Barbell/DB | 3–6 | Improves scapular retraction |

**Modality Guidance (Strength):**
- **Barbell > Dumbbell > Machine** for 1RM strength testing (specificity principle).[5][6]
- Barbell provides: constant resistance across full ROM; higher loads possible; intermuscular coordination demand.
- Dumbbells acceptable for: warm-ups, weak-point training, unilateral strength work.
- Machines: rarely used for maximal strength goals; reserve for recovery or isolation.

### HYPERTROPHY (Muscle Mass Maximization)

**Core Exercise Priority:**
| Exercise Pattern | Primary Lifts | Rep Range | Load (%1RM) | Sets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lower Quad** | Back Squat, Leg Press, Hack Squat | 6–12 | 70–85% | 3–5 | All modalities effective when equated for effort |
| **Lower Hip** | Deadlift, RDL, Leg Curl | 6–15 | 65–85% | 3–5 | Higher rep-ranges acceptable for RDL/curl |
| **Upper Push** | Bench Press, Incline DB Press, Dips | 6–12 | 70–85% | 3–5 | Dumbbell ≈ barbell for hypertrophy |
| **Upper Pull** | Barbell Row, DB Row, Lat Pulldown | 6–12 | 70–80% | 3–5 | Multiple angles recommended |

**Assistance Exercises (Recommended for Hypertrophy):**
| Muscle Group | Single-Joint Exercise | Rep Range | Load | Sets | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Quadriceps (quad-biased)** | Leg Extension | 10–15 | 60–75% | 3–4 | Leg extension ≈ back squat for quad hypertrophy |
| **Hamstrings** | Leg Curl, Nordic Curl | 8–15 | 65–75% | 3–4 | Eccentric emphasis effective |
| **Chest (isolation)** | Cable Fly, Machine Fly | 10–15 | 50–70% | 3–4 | Metabolic stress without joint stress |
| **Back (isolation)** | Face Pull, Reverse Fly | 12–20 | 50–65% | 3–4 | Shoulder health; high reps reduce load |
| **Bicep** | Barbell/DB Curl, Machine Curl | 8–12 | 60–75% | 2–3 | Isolation; accessory only |
| **Tricep** | Rope Pushdown, Tricep Press | 8–12 | 60–75% | 2–3 | Isolation; accessory only |

**Modality Guidance (Hypertrophy):**
- **All modalities effective:** barbell, dumbbell, machine, cables produce similar hypertrophy when equated for volume, intensity (effort), and ROM.[5][6]
- **Evidence Summary (Heidel et al., 2022):** 
  - Direct comparison (same testing modality as training): no difference between free-weight and machine hypertrophy (ES: -0.055; 95% CI: -0.397, 0.287).
  - Dumbbell provides: unilateral loading; stabilizer recruitment; variable grip options.
  - Machine provides: safety; stability; constant resistance curve (high peak tension near lockout).
  - **Best practice:** Combine modalities within microcycle (variety, deload stress on joints, muscle recruitment variation).

**Weekly Volume Threshold (Hypertrophy):**
- ≥10 sets per muscle group per week optimal for intermediate/advanced.
- 4–10 sets still produces substantial gains for novice.
- >20 sets per muscle per week shows diminishing returns.[3]

### MUSCULAR ENDURANCE (High Reps, Metabolic Stress)

**Core Exercise Priority:**
| Exercise Pattern | Primary Lifts | Rep Range | Load (%1RM) | Sets | Rest | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lower (endurance)** | Squat, Leg Press, RDL | 12–25 | 60–75% | 3–4 | 45–90 s | Higher reps; metabolic stress |
| **Upper (endurance)** | Bench Press, Rows, Push-ups | 12–20 | 60–75% | 3–4 | 45–90 s | Controlled tempo; ROM full |

**Assistance Exercises:**
| Target | Exercise | Rep Range | Load | Sets | Rest | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **All muscle groups** | Circuit-based combinations | 12–25 | 50–70% | 2–3 per round | 15–45 s between exercises | Minimal rest; high systemic fatigue |

**Modality Guidance (Endurance):**
- **Dumbbells or bands preferred** (higher metabolic stress; joint-friendly).
- Machines acceptable (stability allows focus on endurance stimulus).
- Barbell acceptable if form remains strict throughout sets.

| **Receiving Position** | Front Squat (clean) | Barbell | 2–5 | 80–90% | 3–5 | Strength + stability |
| **Lockout Strength** | Push Press, Jerk Dip | Barbell | 3–5 | 75–85% | 3–5 | Shoulder/arm pressing power |
| **Posterior Chain** | Back Squat | Barbell | 3–5 | 80–90% | 3–5 | General strength base |

**Advanced Variations (Technical Corrections):**
| Technical Issue | Correction Exercise | Modality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Premature hip opening | Tempo/Paused Snatch/Clean | Barbell | Slow descent; accentuated tension |
| Tipping forward (bar drift) | Tall Snatch/Clean, Block Snatch | Barbell | Reduces leg drive; emphasizes upper body |
| Weak receiving depth | Pause Front/Overhead Squat | Barbell | Holds 1–3 sec at depth |
| Poor bar proximity | Snatch/Clean Grip Deadlift | Barbell | Reinforces path and positioning |

**Modality Guidance (Olympic Lifting):**
- **Barbell ONLY for competition lifts and primary accessories** (movement pattern specificity; neural patterning).
- Dumbbells/kettlebells acceptable for: general strength work, lower-body movements, or scaled training if barbell access limited.
- **NO machines** for Olympic lifting (loss of stability demand; poor carryover).

## Exercise Selection By Experience Level

### NOVICE (0–6 months training)

**Programming Goals:**
- Master movement patterns.
- Build work capacity.
- Minimal periodization complexity.

**Exercise Selection Strategy:**
1. **Limit exercise variety** (4–6 core exercises max per week).
2. **Prioritize barbell compound movements** (squat, deadlift, bench, row, overhead press, pull-up).
3. **Teach proper form** before adding load.
4. **No single-joint exercises yet** (focus on movement patterns).

**Recommended Exercises:**

| Pattern | Exercise | Modality | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lower Quad** | Back Squat | Barbell | Learn pattern; foundational |
| **Lower Hip** | Deadlift | Barbell | Learn pattern; posterior chain |
| **Upper Push** | Bench Press OR Overhead Press | Barbell | Learn pattern; upper body push |
| **Upper Pull** | Pull-up (assisted) or Barbell Row | Bodyweight/Barbell | Learn pattern; back strength |
| **Core/Misc** | Farmer's Carry OR Plank | Implement-agnostic | Core stability; movement integrity |

**Modality Progression:**
- Weeks 1–3: Bodyweight + learning barbell form (light weights).
- Weeks 4–8: Barbell with progressive load (5–10 lb per session for lower; 2.5–5 lb per session for upper).
- Avoid: machines, dumbbells, cables (inappropriate for learning).

**Load Prescription (Novice):**
- Start at 50–60% estimated 1RM.
- Add weight EVERY session (linear progression).
- Rep scheme: 3 sets × 5 reps OR 5 sets × 3 reps.
- Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

---

### INTERMEDIATE (6 months – 2 years training)

**Programming Goals:**
- Improve specific adaptations (strength, hypertrophy, power).
- Introduce exercise variation (movement angle, modality).
- Implement wave loading and periodization.

**Exercise Selection Strategy:**
1. **Expand exercise variety** (6–10 core + accessories per week).
2. **Introduce modality variation:** barbells, dumbbells, machines (same movement pattern, different demand).
3. **Add single-joint accessories** (weakness correction or hypertrophy focus).
4. **Sport/goal-specific exercises** begin here.

**Recommended Exercises (Hypertrophy-Strength Phase):**

| Pattern | Exercise | Modality | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lower Quad** | Back Squat (main), Front Squat (variant) | Barbell | Main: strength; variant: weak point or hypertrophy |
| **Lower Quad Iso** | Leg Press OR Leg Extension | Machine/Leg Press | Accessory for volume or weak point |
| **Lower Hip** | Deadlift (main), RDL (variant) | Barbell | Main: strength; variant: posterior chain development |
| **Lower Hip Iso** | Leg Curl (prone/seated) | Machine | Hamstring isolation; hypertrophy or balance |
| **Upper Push** | Bench Press (main), Incline DB Press (variant) | Barbell/DB | Main: strength; variant: upper chest development |
| **Upper Push Iso** | Tricep Pushdown OR Dumbbell Press (incline) | Cable/DB | Accessory; weak point correction |
| **Upper Pull** | Barbell Row (main), DB Row (variant) | Barbell/DB | Main: strength; variant: unilateral stability |
| **Upper Pull Iso** | Face Pull OR Reverse Fly | Cable/Band | Shoulder health; rear delt development |

**Modality Expansion (Intermediate):**
- **Barbell:** primary compound lifts (squat, deadlift, bench, row).
- **Dumbbell:** secondary compound (DB press, DB row, DB lunge); better for unilateral work.
- **Machine:** accessories; isolation (leg press, leg extension, lat pulldown, leg curl).
- **Cables:** accessories; high-rep work; low injury risk.
- **Bands/Bodyweight:** warm-ups, accessories, deload work.

**Exercise Order Prescription (Intermediate):**
1. Power or heavy compound (if present) → CNS fresh.
2. Main lift (strength focus) → highest load.
3. Secondary compound (hypertrophy/volume) → moderate load.
4. Accessories (single-joint) → lower load, higher reps.

---

### ADVANCED (2+ years dedicated training)

**Programming Goals:**
- Maximize sport-specific or competitive performance.
- Complex periodization (block, conjugate, daily undulating).
- High-level weak-point correction.

**Exercise Selection Strategy:**
1. **Highly specialized:** 3–5 core exercises selected for current block; minimal "filler."
2. **Weak-point exercises prioritized** (specific variations target competition sticking points).
3. **Competition lift modalities** (e.g., powerlifting: main compound variants only; Olympic: snatch/clean + pulls/squats).
4. **Recovery modalities** integrated (active recovery, low-load work, mobility).

**Recommended Exercises (Advanced Powerlifting Example):**

| Phase | Exercise | Modality | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strength Phase (Squat)** | Back Squat (main), Pin Squat (variant at weak point), Bulgarian Split Squat (accessory) | Barbell/Box/DB | Develop 1RM; address sticking point; unilateral leg strength |
| **Strength Phase (Bench)** | Bench Press (main), Pins Press (variant), Weighted Dips (accessory) | Barbell/Box/Bodyweight | Develop 1RM; lockout strength; tricep power |
| **Strength Phase (Deadlift)** | Deadlift (main), Block Deadlift (variant), Snatch Grip Deadlift (accessory) | Barbell | Develop 1RM; address starting strength; grip/back development |
| **Hypertrophy Phase** | Front Squat, Incline DB Press, Chest-Supported Row, Leg Press | Barbell/DB/Machine | Volume emphasis; weak-point hypertrophy |
| **Deload Phase** | High-rep back squat, leg press, machine work | Barbell/Machine | Recovery; volume reduction; technical refinement |

**Modality Constraints (Advanced):**
- **Barbell prioritized** for competition lifts (specificity of adaptation).
- **Dumbbells/machines used selectively** for weak-point accessories or deload variation.
- **NO novel modalities** (stick with proven effective variations).

## Exercise Selection By Injury History

### Classification & Framework

**Injury Status:**
1. **No history:** Standard programming; all modalities available.
2. **Previous injury (healed):** Full participation; monitor movement quality; may emphasize preventive accessories.
3. **Chronic limitation:** Modify ROM, load, or modality; emphasize stability/control.
4. **Acute rehab (post-injury/surgery):** Phased return; progressive loading; movement re-education.

### Return-to-Sport Progression (Phased Approach)

**Phase 1: Early Loading & Normal Movement (Weeks 1–4)**
- Goal: Restore pain-free movement patterns; basic strength.
- Load: Bodyweight or 0.5–1.0× body weight (BW).
- Exercises: Bilateral patterns, reduced ROM if needed.
- Examples:
  - Bilateral bodyweight squat (partial depth if needed).
  - Bilateral step-up (6–8" height).
  - Supine push-up or wall push-up.
  - Bilateral leg press (if barbell squat too stressful).
  - Scapular wall slides; dead hangs (not full pull-ups).
  - Sled push/pull (low load, <50% 1RM equivalent).

**Phase 2: Progressive Loading & Unilateral Introduction (Weeks 5–8)**
- Goal: Increase load tolerance; introduce unilateral stability.
- Load: 1.0–1.5× BW on bilateral; <1.0× BW on unilateral.
- Exercises: Split stances, single-leg focus; gradually increase depth/ROM.
- Examples:
  - Back squat with partial ROM → gradual depth increase.
  - Split squat or reverse lunge (dumbbell).
  - Single-leg balance exercises; single-leg press (machine).
  - Assisted pull-ups (2–3 reps, progress to unassisted).
  - Rowing (machine or DB) with increased ROM.

**Phase 3: Sport-Specific Loading (Weeks 9–12)**
- Goal: Return to competition movement patterns; high loads.
- Load: 1.5–2.0× BW bilaterally; match competition demands.
- Exercises: Full ROM; sport/competition-specific patterns.
- Examples:
  - Full back squat at competitive load (85–95% 1RM).
  - Olympic lifts (if appropriate for sport) with technical precision.
  - Plyometrics (jump squats, bounds, lateral bounds) if cleared.
  - Full-contact sport movements (with graduated intensity).

### Injury-Specific Exercise Modifications

**Lower Extremity (Knee/ACL Injury History):**

| Contraindicated | Caution | Recommended | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deep squat (early rehab) | Barbell squat (progress gradually) | Leg press (bilateral, partial ROM) | Reduced shear force; controlled environment |
| Unilateral loading (early) | Single-leg squat (progress over weeks) | Split squat (progresses to pistol squat) | Graduated unilateral demand |
| Jump/plyometric (early) | Controlled plyometric (weeks 6+) | Isometric holds; pause squats | Neural patterning without impact |
| Cutting/pivoting (early) | Lateral movements (low intensity) | Sled push (lateral direction) | Functional movement without joint stress |

**Shoulder/Rotator Cuff Injury History:**

| Contraindicated | Caution | Recommended | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Barbell bench (early) | Dumbbell press (controlled ROM) | Machine press or floor press | Reduced shear; controlled arc |
| Full overhead position (early) | Partial OH press; push press | Scapular wall slides; dead hangs | Mobility restoration; stability |
| External rotation under load (early) | Lateral band walks; face pulls (light) | Internal rotation (0° abduction) | Avoid impingement; strengthen external rotators |
| Pulling with wide grip | Narrow-grip rowing (light); assisted pull-up | Machine pull-down or lat pull | Reduced shoulder stress |

**Lower Back (Lumbar Spine Injury):**

| Contraindicated | Caution | Recommended | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hyperextension (early) | Deadlift variation (RDL, trap bar) | Back squat (neutral spine maintained) | Neutral spine; compressive rather than shear |
| Unsupported flexion | Barbell squat (advanced stage) | Leg press; leg extension | No spinal flexion; stabilization via machine |
| Explosive loading | Cleans/snatches (advanced) | Trap bar deadlift | Reduces shear vs. conventional deadlift |
| Unilateral loading (early) | Sled push; single-leg work (weeks 6+) | Bilateral movements (weeks 1–4) | Symmetric loading; spinal stability |

## Exercise Selection By Equipment Availability

### Resource-Constrained Scenarios

**Scenario 1: FULL GYM (Barbell, Dumbbells, Machines, Cables)**
- Priority: Barbell compound lifts + modality variation.
- Exercises: All modalities available; no constraints.

**Scenario 2: DUMBBELLS ONLY (+ Minimal Accessories)**
- Available: Dumbbells, bench, pull-up bar (optional), bands (optional).
- Constraints: No barbell, machines, or cables.
- Exercise Modifications:

| Goal | Original | Dumbbell Substitute | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strength** | Back Squat | Goblet Squat or Dumbbell Front Squat | Lower load capacity (will impact max strength ceiling) |
| **Strength** | Deadlift | Dumbbell RDL or Trap-Bar Substitute (off-center DB load) | Lower load capacity; less posterior chain recruitment |
| **Strength** | Bench Press | Dumbbell Floor Press or DB Incline Press | Lower load capacity; less stability demand (but higher ROM) |
| **Strength** | Barbell Row | Single-Arm DB Row or Chest-Supported DB Row | Unilateral instability (good); lower load |
| **Hypertrophy** | Leg Extension | Bulgarian Split Squat (DB) or DB Lunge | Posterior chain emphasis (good); requires more space |
| **Hypertrophy** | Leg Curl | Nordic Curl or Single-Leg RDL (DB) | Eccentric-emphasis; good; functional |
| **Hypertrophy** | Bench Press | DB Bench Press (incline/flat/decline) | Higher ROM; unilateral instability; good carryover |

**Programming for Dumbbell-Only:**
- Emphasize bilateral movements (goblet squat > single-arm goblet squat).
- Use tempo work (eccentric emphasis) to increase time under tension.
- Increase rep ranges (12–20) to compensate for lower load.
- Use unilateral work (single-arm row, single-leg squat) for stability demand.

**Scenario 3: BODYWEIGHT + BANDS (Home/Outdoor)**
- Available: Bodyweight, resistance bands (variable tension).
- Constraints: No external load; limited load progression on some lifts.
- Exercise Modifications:

| Goal | Original | Bodyweight/Band Substitute | Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strength** | Back Squat | Pistol Squat (bodyweight) or Band-Resisted Squat | Progression: assisted pistol → full pistol; band adds resistance |
| **Strength** | Deadlift | Single-Leg RDL or Band-Resisted RDL | Single-leg focus; band assists |
| **Strength** | Bench Press | Push-up (decline, archer, pseudo-planche) | Progression: wall push-up → incline → flat → decline |
| **Strength** | Rows | Pull-up (assisted, band-resisted) | Progression: dead hang → assisted pull-up → full pull-up |
| **Hypertrophy** | Leg Extension | Sissy Squat or Band-Resisted Leg Extension | Quad emphasis; joint-friendly |
| **Hypertrophy** | Leg Curl | Nordic Curl (eccentric-only) or Band-Resisted Curl | Eccentric-emphasis; effective for hypertrophy |
| **Hypertrophy** | Chest Fly | Band Fly or Pseudo-Planche Hold | Pectoral isolation; band variable resistance |

**Band Properties & Modality Guidance:**
- **Band Resistance Characteristics:** Linear variable resistance (LVR); tension increases with stretch.
- **Best for:** Hypertrophy (metabolic stress); endurance; deload work.
- **Less ideal for:** Maximal strength (constant resistance flat; accommodating resistance top-heavy).
- **Combination approach:** Barbell + bands (accommodating resistance); enhances strength development.

**Programming for Bodyweight/Band:**
- Use progression frameworks (e.g., push-up progressions: wall → incline → flat → decline → one-arm).
- Leverage tempo (slow eccentrics) for hypertrophy.
- Combine bands + bodyweight for load increase (e.g., band-resisted pull-up).
- High rep ranges (15–25) to maintain metabolic stress.

## Implementation Recommendations for App

1. **Exercise Library:** Codify exercises with tags (core/accessory/power; barbell/DB/machine; movement pattern; experience required; injury contraindications).

2. **Modality Rules:**
   - **Strength:** Barbell > Dumbbell > Machine (specificity). If barbell unavailable, allow substitution but flag load ceiling.
   - **Hypertrophy:** All modalities acceptable when equated for volume and effort. Recommend rotation (variety benefit).
   - **Power/Olympic:** Barbell mandatory for competition lifts; alternatives only if barbell unavailable (flag as suboptimal).

3. **Injury Gating:** If acute rehab detected, filter all exercises through injury-specific ROM/load constraints; auto-suggest modifications.

4. **Weak-Point Correction:** Allow coaches to flag weak-point exercises; prioritize in subsequent phases.

5. **Exercise Rotation:** Prevent same exercise >2 consecutive sessions; recommend alternatives from ranked pool.

6. **Feedback Loop:** Log RPE, movement quality, soreness per exercise; adjust future recommendations if movement quality drops or soreness persists.

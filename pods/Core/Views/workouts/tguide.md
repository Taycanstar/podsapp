# Evidence-Based Adaptive Strength Training Programming Guide

## Overview

This guide synthesizes current resistance training research (RCTs, meta-analyses, 2023–2024) to provide codifiable rules for an adaptive strength-training app. It covers optimal sets, reps, loading (%1RM or RPE), programming by goal (hypertrophy, strength, muscular endurance, Olympic weightlifting, circuit training, powerlifting) and experience level (novice, intermediate, advanced). It includes biomarker-based microcycle adjustments for fatigue, soreness, and HRV.

## Foundational Evidence Summaries

### 1. Sets and Reps for Hypertrophy
**Meta-analysis Finding (Krieger, 2010; Schoenfeld et al., 2017):**
- **1 set vs. 2–3 sets:** 2–3 sets yield ~40% greater hypertrophy gains than single sets.
- **2–3 sets vs. 4–6 sets:** Minimal additional gain above 2–3 sets; diminishing returns emerge.
- **Optimal weekly volume:** ≥10 sets per muscle group per week (for intermediate/advanced); 4–10 sets can produce substantial gains (for novice/time-constrained).[2][3]
- **Rep range:** 6–12 reps equally effective when equated for effort (proximity to failure). Higher reps (12–20) and lower reps (3–8) work if volume and effort are matched.[2]

### 2. Strength Adaptations
**Meta-analysis Finding (Loomis et al., 2023; Schoenfeld et al., 2016):**
- **Load is critical:** >80% 1RM significantly outperforms <80% 1RM for 1RM strength gains.
- **Higher-load, multiset, thrice-weekly** (3×/week at ≥80% 1RM) is the highest-ranked prescription for strength (SMD: 1.60 [95% CI: 1.38–1.82] vs. control).[1]
- **Lower-body exercises** (squat, deadlift) and **upper-body compound** (bench press, rows) respond best to heavy loads (≥80% 1RM).

### 3. Experience Level Periodization
**Definition & Adaptation Timescale (Rippetoe; Loomis et al., 2023):**
- **Novice:** Can produce adaptation and recover within 48–72 h (typically <6 months training). Complex-parallel periodization; minimal volume/intensity manipulation needed.
- **Intermediate:** Requires 1–2 week recovery windows; Texas Method or 3-week wave loading appropriate; typically 6–24 months trained.
- **Advanced:** Requires 2–4 week blocks; block periodization necessary; >2 years dedicated training.[4]

## Programming Rules by Goal

### HYPERTROPHY

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load** | 65–75% 1RM | 70–85% 1RM | 70–100% 1RM (variable) |
| **Reps** | 8–12 | 6–12 | 3–20 (higher volume emphasis) |
| **Sets per exercise** | 2–3 | 3–4 | 3–6 (per exercise) |
| **Weekly sets per muscle** | 4–10 | 10–15 | 15–25 |
| **Rest between sets** | 60–90 s | 90–120 s | 90–120 s |
| **Frequency per muscle** | 1–2×/week | 2–3×/week | 2–4×/week |
| **RPE target** | 6–8/10 | 6–9/10 | 5–10/10 (varies) |

**Evidence Base:** Loomis et al., 2023 found all load/rep combinations promote hypertrophy equally when volume is matched and effort is high. Multiset protocols (≥2 sets) outperform single sets by ~40%.[1][3]

---

### MAXIMAL STRENGTH

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load** | 75–85% 1RM | 80–90% 1RM | 85–100% 1RM |
| **Reps** | 3–5 | 2–5 | 1–3 (+ heavy singles) |
| **Sets per exercise** | 3–5 | 4–6 | 5–8 |
| **Weekly sets per muscle** | 8–15 | 12–20 | 15–30 |
| **Rest between sets** | 2–3 min | 3–5 min | 3–5 min |
| **Frequency per muscle** | 2–3×/week | 2–3×/week | 2–3×/week (+ accessory) |
| **RPE target** | 8–9/10 | 9–10/10 (1–2 reps in reserve) | 9–10/10 (competition lifts) |

**Evidence Base:** >80% 1RM (i.e., 85–90% 1RM) maximizes 1RM strength gains. Higher frequency with adequate recovery (microcycle planning) sustains CNS adaptation. Loomis et al., 2023: 3×/week at ≥80% 1RM was top-ranked (SMD: 1.60).[1]

---

### MUSCULAR ENDURANCE (Metabolic Stress Focus)

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load** | 50–70% 1RM | 60–75% 1RM | 60–80% 1RM |
| **Reps** | 12–20 | 15–25 | 20–30+ |
| **Sets per exercise** | 2–3 | 3–4 | 3–5 |
| **Rest between sets** | 30–60 s | 45–90 s | 30–60 s (circuit-style) |
| **Frequency per muscle** | 2–3×/week | 2–3×/week | 2–4×/week |
| **RPE target** | 6–8/10 | 7–9/10 | 7–10/10 |

**Evidence Base:** Lower loads with high reps (12–25) produce metabolic stress and endurance adaptations. Short rest intervals (30–60 s) amplify metabolic stress.[2][3]

---

### OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING (Technical Power)

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load (Snatch/C&J)** | 60–75% 1RM (singles) | 70–85% 1RM | 80–100% 1RM (comp. weight) |
| **Reps per set** | 3–5 singles (learn form) | 2–3 singles | 1–2 singles (+ triples at 70–75%) |
| **Sets per exercise** | 4–6 | 5–8 | 6–10 (main lift) |
| **Rest between sets** | 2–3 min | 3–5 min | 4–5 min |
| **Frequency (main lift)** | 2–3×/week | 3×/week | 3–4×/week (incl. variants) |
| **RPE target** | 6–7/10 (technique) | 7–8/10 (speed/form) | 8–10/10 (competition) |
| **Progression scheme** | Week 1: 4×4 → Week 7: restart | Wave load (e.g., 3×3, 2×2, 1×1) | Variable (periodized macro-blocks) |

**Evidence Base:** Olympic lifting prioritizes neuromuscular coordination and rate of force development (RFD); lower rep counts preserve technique. Velocity-based training (VBT) is standard; RPE/RIR autoregulation critical for quality. Minimal rep progression (e.g., 4×4 → 4×3 → 4×2 → 4×1 over weeks) prevents accumulated fatigue.[5][6]

---

### POWERLIFTING (Strength + Hypertrophy Hybrid)

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load (main lift)** | 75–85% 1RM | 80–90% 1RM | 85–100% 1RM |
| **Reps (main lift)** | 3–5 | 2–4 | 1–3 (+ heavy doubles) |
| **Accessory load** | 65–80% 1RM | 70–85% 1RM | 70–100% 1RM (varies) |
| **Accessory reps** | 6–10 | 6–10 | 6–15 (varies by purpose) |
| **Total sets (main + acc.)** | 8–12 per session | 12–18 per session | 15–25 per session |
| **Frequency per lift** | 2×/week | 2–3×/week | 2–3×/week (+ variants) |
| **Rest (main lift)** | 3–4 min | 4–5 min | 4–5+ min |
| **Rest (accessories)** | 60–90 s | 90–120 s | 60–120 s (variable) |
| **RPE target** | 8–9/10 | 9–10/10 (1–2 RIR) | 9–10/10 (openers–attempt planning) |

**Evidence Base:** Powerlifting prioritizes the squat, bench, deadlift at high loads. Accessories drive hypertrophy and weakness mitigation. Microcycle: volume day (higher reps, 70–80% 1RM) → light/deload day → intensity day (heavy singles, 90–100% 1RM). Periodized to peak for meet.[1]

---

### CIRCUIT TRAINING (Cardio + Strength Hybrid)

| **Parameter** | **Novice** | **Intermediate** | **Advanced** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Load** | 50–65% 1RM | 60–75% 1RM | 65–80% 1RM |
| **Reps per exercise** | 10–15 | 12–20 | 15–25 |
| **# of exercises per circuit** | 4–6 | 6–8 | 8–10 |
| **Sets (rounds)** | 2–3 | 3–4 | 3–5 |
| **Rest between exercises** | 15–30 s | 20–45 s | 15–30 s (or none) |
| **Rest between rounds** | 2–3 min | 2–3 min | 1–2 min |
| **Frequency** | 2–3×/week | 2–3×/week | 3–4×/week |
| **RPE target** | 6–8/10 (per exercise) | 7–9/10 | 8–10/10 (per round) |
| **Cardio benefit** | VO₂max +3–5% | VO₂max +5–7% | VO₂max +6–8% |

**Evidence Base:** Circuit training produces 4.3% fat loss, 1.9% muscle gain, and 6.3% VO₂max increase over 12+ weeks (meta-analysis, 2021). Short rest (10–30 s) and moderate loads (60–75% 1RM) optimize metabolic stress and conditioning.[2][41]

## Autoregulation & Microcycle Adjustments

### Biomarker-Based Volume/Intensity Adjustment Framework

Use these biomarkers to adjust within a microcycle (daily/48 h) WITHOUT changing long-term periodization:

#### **HRV (Heart Rate Variability) – Primary Autonomic Marker**

**Measurement:**
- **Ln RMSSD** (natural log root mean square of successive RR intervals) is the standard parasympathetic marker.
- Measure **supine morning HRV** (standardized: 5-min stabilization + 5-min recording).
- **Trending:** Use rolling 3–7-day average to reduce noise.

**Interpretation:**

| **HRV Trend** | **Interpretation** | **Microcycle Action** | **Evidence** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **↓ 7–10% vs. baseline** | Moderate parasympathetic withdrawal; normal training stress | Proceed as planned (RPE 7–9/10) | Chen et al., 2011; Kingsley & Figueroa, 2016[6] |
| **↓ 10–15% vs. baseline** | Elevated autonomic perturbation; possible CNS fatigue | Reduce volume by 20–30%; maintain intensity; focus on technique | Bellenger et al., 2016[6] |
| **↓ >15% or 2–3 consecutive days low** | Overreaching signal; risk of maladaptation | **Deload:** 40–50% normal volume; low intensity (50–60% 1RM) or complete rest day | Hecksteden et al., 2016[6] |
| **↑ 5–10% vs. baseline** | Improved parasympathetic reactivation; good recovery | Can increase volume/intensity slightly if planned | Pareja-Blanco et al., 2017[6] |

**Implementation Rule:**
```
IF HRV_morning < (baseline_HRV - 0.15 * baseline_HRV) AND duration > 2 days:
    THEN implement_deload_microcycle()
ELSE IF HRV < (baseline - 0.10 * baseline) AND RPE_target > 8:
    THEN reduce_sets_by_20_percent()
    AND maintain_load_percent_1RM()
ELSE:
    proceed_as_planned()
```

#### **Muscle Soreness (DOMS) & Soreness Scoring**

**Measurement:**
- Rate perceived muscle soreness on **0–10 scale** (visual analog scale, VAS) for primary movers (e.g., quads post-squat, pecs post-bench).
- Assess **24–48 h post-exercise** (peak DOMS window).

**Interpretation:**

| **Soreness Score (24–48 h)** | **Microcycle Adjustment** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|
| 0–3/10 | Proceed as planned | Normal; muscle is adapted |
| 4–6/10 | Mild caution; reduce volume by 10–15% OR increase rest 1 day | Acceptable for intermediate/advanced; novice should reduce |
| 7–8/10 | Reduce volume 30%; maintain or lower intensity; add +1 day rest before next session | Excessive soreness impairs performance; recovery priority |
| 9–10/10 | Deload day (40–50% volume, low-intensity, mobility work) or full rest | Risk of strength loss if soreness not managed |

**Implementation Rule:**
```
IF soreness_score_24h > 6:
    THEN reduce_volume_by_20_30_percent()
    AND increase_rest_period_by_1_day()
ELSE IF soreness_score_48h > 6:
    THEN deload_or_rest_next_session()
```

#### **Lactate Accumulation & Acute Fatigue (Proxy: Session RPE)**

**Measurement:**
- Record **session RPE** (0–10 scale) immediately post-workout.
- Also record **lactate discomfort** during final sets (if using high-rep schemes, <60 s rest).

**Interpretation:**

| **Session RPE + Lactate Markers** | **Action** | **Evidence** |
|---|---|---|
| RPE 7–8, mild burn ≤2 sets | Normal training stress | Proceed |
| RPE 8–9, moderate burn 3–4 sets | Elevated metabolic stress | OK for hypertrophy/endurance; reduce if strength focus |
| RPE 9–10 + severe lactate burn for 5+ sets | High fatigue accumulation | Reduce next session volume OR take full rest day |

**Implementation Rule:**
```
IF session_RPE > 9 AND lactate_perceived_high:
    THEN schedule_full_rest_OR_40_percent_volume_reduction_next_session()
```

#### **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) & Reps in Reserve (RIR)**

**Standard RPE Scale (0–10):**
- **RPE 5:** Effort where 5 reps remain before failure
- **RPE 6–7:** 3–4 reps in reserve (hypertrophy sweet spot)
- **RPE 8:** 2 reps in reserve (strength + hypertrophy)
- **RPE 9:** 1 rep in reserve (strength-dominant)
- **RPE 10:** Maximal effort (1RM attempts)

**Warm-up Protocol to Assess Daily Readiness (Autoregulation):**
1. Perform 2–3 warm-up sets at ~60–70% intended working weight.
2. **If warm-up feels easy (RPE 4–5):** Increase working load by 5–10%.
3. **If warm-up feels heavy (RPE 7–8):** Reduce load by 5–10% or increase reps; OR reduce total volume.
4. **If warm-up feels very heavy (RPE 9–10):** Do not attempt planned intensity; reduce by 15–20% or deload.

**Implementation Rule:**
```
warm_up_RPE = assess_60_70_percent_1RM_for_2_sets()
IF warm_up_RPE >= 8:
    THEN reduce_load_by_10_15_percent()
ELSE IF warm_up_RPE <= 4:
    THEN increase_load_by_5_10_percent()
ELSE:
    proceed_as_planned()
```

## Microcycle Construction (Weekly Planning with Biomarker Integration)

### Example: Intermediate Lifter (Strength Focus, 3×/Week Split)

**Template with Biomarker Gates:**

| **Day** | **Primary Goal** | **Load** | **Volume** | **RPE Target** | **Biomarker Gate** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mon (AM HRV check)** | **Heavy Day (Intensity)** | 85–90% 1RM | 5–6 sets × 2–3 reps | 8–9/10 | If HRV ↓>10%, reduce to 4 sets |
| **Wed** | **Volume Day (Hypertrophy)** | 70–80% 1RM | 4 sets × 6–8 reps | 7–8/10 | If soreness >6/10 from Mon, reduce to 3 sets |
| **Fri** | **Moderate Day (Technical/Accessory)** | 75–80% 1RM | 3–4 sets × 5–6 reps (main) + 3 sets × 8–10 (acc.) | 7/10 | If HRV still low, defer to 50% volume; mobility instead |
| **Post-Fri (48 h soreness check)** | — | — | — | — | If soreness >7/10, schedule extra rest day before Mon |

---

## Velocity-Based Training (VBT) – Objective Autoregulation

**Alternative to RPE for precise daily adjustments:**

| **Lift Phase** | **Target Velocity** | **Adjustment** |
|---|---|---|
| **Strength (2–5 reps)** | ≥0.75 m/s (bar velocity) | If velocity <0.75 m/s on rep 3–5, reduce load 5%; OR stop set |
| **Hypertrophy (6–12 reps)** | 0.50–0.75 m/s (starting), allowing drop to 0.30–0.50 m/s on final reps | Stop set when velocity drops >30% from first rep |
| **Endurance (15–25 reps)** | 0.30–0.50 m/s | Pace self; rest as needed to maintain form |

**Equipment:** Bar velocity trackers (GymAware, PUSH band, Traction app) provide objective feedback unavailable from RPE alone.[5]

---

## Deload Microcycle Protocol

**Trigger:** Use when 2–3 consecutive days of low HRV (<baseline - 15%), high soreness (>7/10), or cumulative fatigue signs.

| **Parameter** | **Deload Week** |
|---|---|
| **Volume** | 40–50% of normal (3 sessions instead of 5; 2 sets instead of 4) |
| **Load** | 50–65% 1RM (or 60–70% for Olympic lifts) |
| **Reps** | 8–10 (or 2–3 singles for Oly) |
| **RPE** | 5–6/10 (purposefully submaximum) |
| **Rest** | 1–2 min (normal rest; focus on enjoying the movement) |
| **Duration** | 1 week (rarely >2) |
| **Purpose** | Parasympathetic reactivation; connective tissue recovery; CNS restoration |

## Implementation Priorities for the App

1. **Core Biomarker Collection:** Morning HRV (RMSSD), session RPE, post-exercise soreness (24–48 h).
2. **Warm-up Autoregulation:** Daily load/volume adjustment based on warm-up RPE or velocity (if VBT hardware available).
3. **Microcycle Gates:** HRV <baseline - 15% triggers automatic deload or 50% volume cut.
4. **Fatigue Scoring:** Rolling 3–7-day average of HRV + soreness + session RPE to flag overreach before injury.
5. **Goal-Specific Logic:** Switch programming rules based on stated goal (hypertrophy, strength, endurance, sport-specific).
6. **Velocity Feedback (Optional Advanced):** Integrate bar-velocity apps (GymAware, PUSH) for real-time velocity-based autoregulation.

## Codification Notes for App Developers

**Deterministic logic structure:**
- Use **tiered conditionals** for HRV, soreness, RPE gates before executing session.
- **Deload triggers:** Any 2+ days of low HRV (<baseline - 15%) OR consecutive soreness >7/10 OR cumulative fatigue score >0.4.
- **Daily adjustments:** Apply load/volume multipliers (±5–20%) based on warm-up RPE/velocity.
- **Goal-switching:** Periodically (4–8 weeks) allow user to toggle goal; repopulate load/rep targets accordingly.
- **Data logging:** Capture HRV, soreness (VAS), session RPE, velocity (if available), and derive 7-day rolling averages for trend analysis.
- **Predictive alerts:** Flag overreach risk 3–5 days in advance if fatigue trend is rising.

# Context Session 1: Warmup/Cooldown Exercise Science Implementation

## Current Task
Analyzing exercise science aspects of warmup/cooldown implementation based on Fitbod's research and best practices for proper exercise taxonomy and muscle group targeting.

## Issues Identified
- User enables warmup/cooldown but sections don't appear in workout
- Limited stretching/mobility exercises in current database
- Need proper exercise categorization for warmup/cooldown phases

## Research Focus
- Exercise taxonomy for warmup/cooldown phases
- Muscle group targeting based on main workout content
- Duration and progression principles
- Intensity-based recommendations

## Key Findings
- Database has 1200 exercises: 964 Strength, 139 Stretching, 75 Aerobic
- TodayWorkout model already has warmUpExercises/coolDownExercises arrays
- WorkoutGenerationService has getOptimalWarmupDuration() but no generation logic
- Infrastructure exists but exercise selection algorithms are missing

## Implementation Plan Created
- Comprehensive exercise science implementation plan created at:
  `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/.claude/doc/warmup_cooldown_exercise_science_implementation.md`
- Plan includes exercise taxonomy, muscle targeting algorithms, and progression principles
- Based on Fitbod's proven 3-phase warmup approach and static cooldown protocols
- Detailed technical implementation with code examples and integration points

## Status
- COMPLETED: Exercise science analysis and comprehensive implementation plan
- Next: Parent agent should read implementation plan before proceeding with development

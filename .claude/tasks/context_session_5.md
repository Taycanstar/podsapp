# Session Context 5: Duration Exercise Timer Interface

## Task Overview
Design and specify a timer interface for duration-based workout exercises in ExerciseLoggingView following Apple's design guidelines.

## Current Problem
Users currently manually input exercise durations for time-based exercises (timeOnly, timeDistance, holdTime, rounds), but need live timer functionality to track active duration sets during workouts.

## Requirements
1. **Bottom Action Buttons Layout** for `workoutInProgress` on duration exercises:
   - Left: "Start Timer" button
   - Right: "Log Set" button (existing functionality)  
   - When all sets completed: Single "Done" button (replace both)

2. **Timer Sheet Interface**:
   - Coverage: 1/4 of screen (quarter-sheet style)
   - Clean, sleek Apple-style interface
   - Left: X mark to dismiss/cancel timer
   - Auto-logs set when timer completes
   - Native iOS timer feel

## Technical Context
- SwiftUI app with iOS 17.2+ minimum
- Parent view: ExerciseLoggingView
- Exercise types: Duration-based only (timeOnly, timeDistance, holdTime, rounds)
- Data: Sets contain duration (TimeInterval) and completion state
- Integration: Must work with FlexibleExerciseInputs and DynamicSetsInputView

## Design Scope
Need complete UI/UX specification covering:
- Bottom button layout and hierarchy
- Timer sheet design and interactions
- Timer controls and progress feedback  
- State management (running, paused, completed, cancelled)
- Auto-logging behavior
- Accessibility requirements
- Animation and transition guidelines

## Status
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive Apple-style timer interface specification created
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Detailed implementation plan with SwiftUI components
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: User flows and interaction patterns documented
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Accessibility and animation requirements specified
- ðŸ“‹ **READY**: Implementation plan available at `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/.claude/doc/duration-exercise-timer-interface-design.md`
- ðŸŽ¯ **ACHIEVED**: Complete design specification ready for development implementation

## Key Deliverables Created
1. **Comprehensive UI/UX Design**: Quarter-sheet timer with dual bottom button layout
2. **Apple HIG-Compliant Specifications**: Native iOS timer patterns with accessibility
3. **SwiftUI Architecture Plan**: TimerManager, DurationExerciseTimerSheet, CircularProgressRing
4. **User Flow Documentation**: Complete interaction scenarios and edge cases
5. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased development approach with acceptance criteria

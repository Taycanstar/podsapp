# Session Context 6: Duration Input Persistence Issue

## Task Overview
Analyze and fix duration input persistence issue in SwiftUI exercise logging view where user-inputted duration gets reset to 0 when workout timer starts.

## Current Problem Analysis
**Issue**: When user sets duration before starting workout, the value gets reset to 0 when workout starts.

**Current Broken Flow**:
1. User inputs duration in `DynamicSetRowView` (in FlexibleExerciseInputs.swift) 
2. Duration input uses `@Binding var set: FlexibleSetData`
3. When timer starts, `startTimer()` in ExerciseLoggingView.swift looks for `incompleteSet.duration`
4. Duration is 0 or nil, so falls back to default
5. Only AFTER timer completes does `autoLogSetFromTimer()` save duration to the set

**Expected Correct Flow**:
1. User inputs duration â†’ should immediately save to `FlexibleSetData.duration`  
2. When timer starts â†’ should use the saved duration from the set
3. When timer completes â†’ just mark as completed, duration already saved

## Key Files Analyzed
- `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Views/workouts/ExerciseLoggingView.swift` - Contains `startTimer()` and timer logic
- `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Components/FlexibleExerciseInputs.swift` - Contains `DynamicSetRowView` with duration inputs
- `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Views/workouts/DynamicSetsInputView.swift` - Container for set rows with binding management

## Root Cause Analysis
The binding pattern appears correct on the surface, but there's likely a subtle issue preventing duration persistence.

## Status
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Analyzed current codebase and identified binding flow
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Identified root cause of persistence issue (SwiftUI picker binding deferral)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive implementation plan at `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/.claude/doc/duration-input-persistence-fix.md`
- ðŸ“‹ **READY**: Implementation plan available for development team
- ðŸŽ¯ **ACHIEVED**: Complete analysis and solution architecture provided

## Technical Context
- SwiftUI app with iOS 17.2+ minimum
- Duration-based exercises: timeOnly, timeDistance, holdTime, rounds
- Uses FlexibleSetData model with `duration: TimeInterval?` property
- Binding flows: ExerciseLoggingView â†’ DynamicSetsInputView â†’ DynamicSetRowView
- Timer functionality managed in ExerciseLoggingView with TimerManager

# Session Context 4: iOS Clock-Style Time Picker Implementation

## Task Overview
Implement a native iOS Clock app-style time picker in SwiftUI that matches the exact interface and behavior of the iOS Clock app's timer interface.

## Current Problem
The existing `TimePickerField` in `FlexibleExerciseInputs.swift` uses `MenuPickerStyle()` which creates dropdown menus instead of the inline wheel picker interface that users expect from the iOS Clock app.

## Requirements
1. Inline wheel picker showing hours, minutes, and seconds (HH:MM:SS format)
2. Matches exact iOS native styling from the Clock app
3. Expands inline when tapped (not a menu or modal)
4. Proper labels and sizing
5. Works within form/list context for exercise duration input
6. Maintains existing visual styling consistency with TikTok-style backgrounds

## Current Implementation Analysis
- Located in: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Components/FlexibleExerciseInputs.swift`
- Lines 282-364: `TimePickerField` struct
- Problem: Uses `MenuPickerStyle()` on lines 315 and 329
- Context: Used in exercise tracking for duration input (planks, cardio, etc.)

## Technical Context
- SwiftUI app with iOS 17.2+ minimum
- Uses custom "tiktoknp" background color
- Integrates with focus state management
- Part of dynamic exercise input system

## Status
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive implementation plan created
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Apple UX-aligned design specification generated
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Technical implementation details documented
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Native iOS time picker implementation with hours/minutes/seconds
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Modern Duration Set Indicators for time-based exercises
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Toolbar Clear/Done buttons for all input types
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Smooth animations and proper layout expansion
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Apple HIG-compliant Progressive Ring System
- ðŸ“‹ **READY**: Implementation plan available at `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/.claude/doc/ios-clock-style-time-picker-implementation.md`
- ðŸ“‹ **READY**: Duration Set Indicator design at `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/.claude/doc/duration-exercise-set-indicators-design.md`
- ðŸŽ¯ **ACHIEVED**: Native iOS Clock app experience for exercise duration input

## Key Deliverables Created
1. **Complete SwiftUI Implementation**: `InlineTimePickerField` with WheelPickerStyle
2. **Visual Design Specifications**: Typography, spacing, colors, interaction states
3. **Accessibility Requirements**: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, focus order
4. **Integration Plan**: Exact file modifications and backward compatibility
5. **Testing Strategy**: Functional, usability, and accessibility testing scenarios

## Implementation Summary
- Replaces `MenuPickerStyle()` with proper `WheelPickerStyle()` in expandable container
- Matches exact iOS Clock app behavior with collapse/expand animation
- Maintains existing TikTok-style visual consistency
- Full backward compatibility with existing `TimePickerField` interface
- Comprehensive accessibility and edge case handling

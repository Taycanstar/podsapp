# Session Context 1: Notes Input Interface Fix

## Task Overview
Redesigning the Notes input interface to follow Apple's design patterns for the fitness app's exercise notes feature.

## Current Issues
1. Input taking up too much vertical space
2. Bottom buttons are not desired
3. Need proper navigation bar button placement

## Requirements
1. Navigation: "Add Notes" title, Cancel (leading), Save (trailing)
2. Input: Single-line text input with reasonable height that grows dynamically
3. Layout: Clean, simple, follows iOS Notes app patterns
4. No extra context: Just the input field, no exercise labels

## Goal
Create optimal height and layout recommendations following Apple HIG for a full-screen NavigationView presentation with TextEditor that starts single-line and grows as needed.

## Status
- ✅ Analyzed current ExerciseNotesSheet.swift implementation
- ✅ Identified key issues: fixed 300pt height, exercise context header, character count footer
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan following Apple Notes patterns
- ✅ Plan created at /Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/.claude/doc/notes-interface-redesign-plan.md

## Key Findings
- Current implementation has fixed 300pt minHeight causing excessive vertical space
- Exercise header section (lines 25-36) should be removed per requirements
- Character count footer creates visual noise and should be simplified
- Navigation structure is already correct (Cancel/Save)

## Recommended Solution
- Start with 40pt initial height (single line)
- Max height of 200pt (9 lines) before internal scrolling  
- Remove exercise context and character count UI
- Change title to "Add Notes"
- Maintain existing save logic and haptic feedback

# Session Context 3: Exercise Science Algorithm Validation

## Task Overview
Validating the current Perplexity algorithm implementation against proper exercise science principles to fix "weird" and impractical results reported by user.

## Current Algorithm Results (Advanced Male, Compound Exercises)
User reported these results from implemented algorithm:
- **Powerlifting**: 5×1 (5 sets of 1 rep)
- **Strength**: 4×2 (4 sets of 2 reps)  
- **Hypertrophy**: 3×7 (3 sets of 7 reps)
- **Endurance**: 3×17 (3 sets of 17 reps)
- **General Fitness**: 3×9 (3 sets of 9 reps)
- **Tone**: 3×12 (3 sets of 12 reps)

## Current Algorithm Implementation
```
Base Reps + Experience Modifier + Gender Modifier + Exercise Type Modifier

Base Reps by Goal:
- Strength: 5, Powerlifting: 3, Hypertrophy: 10, Endurance: 20, General: 12, Tone: 15

Modifiers:
- Experience: Advanced = -1
- Gender: Male = 0  
- Exercise Type: Compound = -2

Sets by Goal:
- Strength: 4, Powerlifting: 5, Hypertrophy: 3, Others: 3
```

## Problem Statement
The algorithm produces mathematically correct results but user reports they're "weird" and impractical. Need exercise science validation and recommendations for evidence-based improvements.

## Key Questions to Address
1. Scientific soundness of current rep/set combinations
2. Practical gym recommendations for each fitness goal  
3. Validation of Perplexity algorithm implementation accuracy
4. Translation of calculated numbers to standard gym schemes
5. Evidence-based recommendations for each fitness goal

## Status
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Exercise science analysis and validation
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Created detailed implementation plan at `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/.claude/doc/exercise-science-algorithm-validation.md`
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Generated evidence-based algorithm improvements

## Key Findings

### Scientific Assessment
The current Perplexity algorithm is **scientifically sound** but produces **impractical results** that don't align with standard gym programming patterns. The core issue is not the exercise science principles, but the lack of practical translation layers.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Mathematically Correct but Weird**: 5×1, 4×2, 3×7 are scientifically valid but unfamiliar to gym users
2. **Overly Aggressive Modifiers**: Experience (-1) and compound (-2) modifiers create impractical combinations  
3. **Missing Standard Mapping**: No translation to recognized rep ranges (5s, 8s, 10s, 12s, 15s)
4. **Progression Unfriendly**: Odd numbers make tracking and equipment selection difficult

### Evidence-Based Solutions
1. **Standard Rep Range Mapping**: Translate algorithm output to practical gym standards
2. **Modifier Adjustment**: Reduce aggressiveness (compound: -2 → -1, advanced: maintain practical ranges)
3. **Program Alignment**: Results match established methodologies (5/3/1, Starting Strength, PPL)

### Improved Results Preview
- **Powerlifting**: 3×3 (practical powerlifting volume)
- **Strength**: 3×5 (classic strength building)  
- **Hypertrophy**: 3×8 (proven hypertrophy range)
- **Endurance**: 3×15 (standard endurance protocol)
- **General Fitness**: 3×10 (universally recognized)
- **Tone**: 3×12 (effective definition work)

## Context
This is for a SwiftUI fitness app that generates workouts. Users expect practical, recognizable rep/set schemes that match common gym programming patterns.

# Fitness Level Filtering System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a fitness level filtering system to prevent inappropriate exercises (like handstands) from being recommended to beginners. The solution implements a 5-level complexity rating system with experience-based filtering.

## Problem Statement

- **Current Issue**: All ~400 exercises are treated equally regardless of difficulty
- **User Impact**: Beginners receiving advanced exercises like handstand push-ups
- **Risk**: Inappropriate exercises can lead to injury and poor user experience

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Complexity Rating System

**5-Level Scale:**
- Level 1: Complete Beginner (basic movements, bodyweight basics)
- Level 2: Beginner (simple compound movements)
- Level 3: Intermediate (complex movements, moderate coordination)
- Level 4: Advanced (high skill movements, significant strength requirements)
- Level 5: Expert (elite movements like handstands, planches, muscle-ups)

**Experience-Based Access:**
- **Beginners**: Complexity 1-2 only
- **Intermediate**: Complexity 1-3
- **Advanced**: Complexity 1-5

### 2. Data Model Updates

#### 2.1 ExerciseData Struct Enhancement
**File**: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Models/WorkoutModels.swift`

**Current Structure:**
```swift
struct ExerciseData: Identifiable, Hashable, Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let exerciseType: String
    let bodyPart: String
    let equipment: String
    let gender: String
    let target: String
    let synergist: String
}
```

**Enhanced Structure:**
```swift
struct ExerciseData: Identifiable, Hashable, Codable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
    let exerciseType: String
    let bodyPart: String
    let equipment: String
    let gender: String
    let target: String
    let synergist: String
    let complexityRating: Int? // NEW: Optional for backward compatibility
    
    // Computed property for safe access with fallback
    var safeComplexityRating: Int {
        return complexityRating ?? estimateComplexity()
    }
    
    // Fallback complexity estimation logic
    private func estimateComplexity() -> Int {
        // Default estimation logic based on exercise name and type
        // This ensures system works even without explicit ratings
    }
}
```

#### 2.2 Exercise Complexity Service
**New File**: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Services/ExerciseComplexityService.swift`

**Purpose**: 
- Centralized complexity rating management
- Default complexity estimation for unrated exercises
- Experience level compatibility checking

**Key Methods:**
```swift
class ExerciseComplexityService {
    static let shared = ExerciseComplexityService()
    
    // Check if exercise is appropriate for user's experience level
    func isExerciseAppropriate(_ exercise: ExerciseData, for experienceLevel: ExperienceLevel) -> Bool
    
    // Get max complexity allowed for experience level
    func getMaxComplexity(for experienceLevel: ExperienceLevel) -> Int
    
    // Estimate complexity for exercises without ratings
    func estimateComplexity(for exercise: ExerciseData) -> Int
    
    // Get exercises filtered by complexity
    func filterExercisesByComplexity(_ exercises: [ExerciseData], for experienceLevel: ExperienceLevel) -> [ExerciseData]
}
```

### 3. Service Layer Integration

#### 3.1 WorkoutRecommendationService Enhancement
**File**: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Services/WorkoutRecommendationService.swift`

**Changes Required:**
1. Add complexity filtering to `getRecommendedExercises` method
2. Integrate with ExerciseComplexityService
3. Ensure compatibility with existing muscle group filtering

**Key Integration Points:**
```swift
func getRecommendedExercises(for muscleGroup: String, count: Int = 5) -> [ExerciseData] {
    let userProfile = UserProfileService.shared
    let allExercises = ExerciseDatabase.getAllExercises()
    
    // EXISTING: Filter by muscle group
    let muscleExercises = allExercises.filter { exercise in
        exerciseMatchesMuscle(exercise, muscleGroup: muscleGroup)
    }
    
    // NEW: Apply complexity filtering
    let complexityFilteredExercises = ExerciseComplexityService.shared
        .filterExercisesByComplexity(muscleExercises, for: userProfile.experienceLevel)
    
    // Continue with existing logic...
}
```

#### 3.2 Exercise Replacement System
**File**: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Views/workouts/ExerciseLoggingView.swift`

**Enhancement**: Add complexity filtering to the `filteredExercises` computed property

### 4. View Layer Updates

#### 4.1 Exercise Selection Views
**Files to Update:**
- `AddExerciseView.swift`
- `BodyweightExercisesView.swift`
- `CardioExercisesView.swift`
- `WeightedExercisesView.swift`
- All other exercise category views

**Pattern**: Add complexity filtering to each view's `filteredExercises` computed property

**Example Implementation:**
```swift
private var filteredExercises: [ExerciseData] {
    let userProfile = UserProfileService.shared
    
    // EXISTING filtering logic...
    let baseFiltered = exercises.filter { /* existing logic */ }
    
    // NEW: Apply complexity filtering
    return ExerciseComplexityService.shared
        .filterExercisesByComplexity(baseFiltered, for: userProfile.experienceLevel)
}
```

### 5. Data Migration Strategy

#### 5.1 ExerciseDatabase Updates
**File**: `/Users/dimi/Documents/dimi/podsapp/pods/Pods/Core/Views/workouts/ExerciseDatabase.swift`

**Approach**: Progressive enhancement with predefined ratings for known exercises

**Initial Complexity Ratings** (Examples):
```swift
// Level 1 (Complete Beginner)
ExerciseData(id: 276, name: "Dead Bug", complexityRating: 1, ...)
ExerciseData(id: 267, name: "Crunch (hands overhead)", complexityRating: 1, ...)

// Level 2 (Beginner) 
ExerciseData(id: 25, name: "Barbell Bench Press", complexityRating: 2, ...)
ExerciseData(id: 294, name: "Dumbbell Biceps Curl", complexityRating: 2, ...)

// Level 5 (Expert)
ExerciseData(id: 894, name: "Handstand Push-Up", complexityRating: 5, ...)
ExerciseData(id: 3444, name: "Handstand Walk", complexityRating: 5, ...)
ExerciseData(id: 6834, name: "Full planche", complexityRating: 5, ...)
```

#### 5.2 Fallback System
For exercises without explicit ratings, implement smart estimation based on:
1. Exercise name pattern matching (e.g., "handstand" â†’ complexity 5)
2. Equipment requirements (bodyweight vs. machines)
3. Movement complexity indicators
4. Default to complexity 3 (safe middle ground)

### 6. State Management

#### 6.1 Experience Level Changes
**Integration Points:**
1. UserProfileService already tracks experience level
2. No additional state management required
3. Views automatically update when experience level changes

#### 6.2 Caching Strategy
**Performance Considerations:**
- Cache filtered exercise lists per experience level
- Invalidate cache when user changes experience level
- Use computed properties for real-time filtering

### 7. Implementation Sequence

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Create ExerciseComplexityService**
   - File: `ExerciseComplexityService.swift`
   - Basic filtering logic and experience level mappings

2. **Enhance ExerciseData Model**

   - Add `safeComplexityRating` computed property
   - Add fallback estimation logic

#### Phase 2: Service Integration

   - Integrate complexity filtering in recommendation methods
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Update Exercise Selection Views**

#### Phase 3: Data Population
1. **Add Initial Complexity Ratings**
   - Rate 50-100 most common exercises
   - Focus on obviously beginner vs. advanced exercises
   - Ensure all Level 5 exercises are properly rated

2. **Implement Smart Estimation**
   - Pattern-based complexity estimation
   - Equipment-based heuristics
   - Safe defaults for unknown exercises

#### Phase 4: Testing & Refinement
